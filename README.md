# Efesa's Coding Interview Prep
This repository contains code I created as part of my journey to get better at algorithms and data structures.

My plan is to update this read me doc with the topics I've covered, and questions under those topics. 

----------------------------
### Arrays
Solutions to array questions can be found in the package com.problems.interviewcake.code.arrays. Test cases can be found in the package com.problems.interviewcake.test.arrays. Test cases share the same name as the solution files, with Test added at the end. Array questions in my repo include:

**1\. Merging Meeting Times:** Write a function for merging meeting times given everyone's schedules.

- Solution File Name: Meetings

**2\. Reverse a Character Array in Place** 

- Solution File Name: ReverseCharacterArray

**3\. Reverse Words:** Write a function to reverse the word order of a string in place.

- Solution File Name: ReverseWords

**4\. Merge 2 Sorted Arrays:** Write a function for merging two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

- Solution File Name: MergeSortedArrays

**5\. Single Riffle Shuffle:** Write a function to determine if a deck of cards is a single riffle of two other halves. A riffle is a shuffle in which the deck of cards is divided into two halves. The top half of the deck is placed in the left hand, and cards are then alternatively interleaved from both hands. 

- Solution File Name: CheckSingleRiffle

**6\. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:** Write a function to remove duplicates from a sorted array. Your function should return the size of the new array.

- Solution File Name: RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray

**7\. Sub Array Sum:** Write a function that checks if an array contains a contiguous sub array whose sum equals a given number.

- Solution File Name: SubarraySum

----------------------------
### Hash Tables
Solutions to hash table questions can be found in the package com.problems.interviewcake.code.hash_tables. Test cases can be found in the package com.problems.interviewcake.test.hash_tables. Test cases share the same name as the solution files, with Test added at the end. Hash table questions in my repo include:

**1\. Array Pair Equals Sum:** Write a function that determines if an array has a pair of elements whose sum equals a given number.

- Solution File Name: ArrayPairEqualsSum

**2\. Permutation Palindrome:** Check if any permutation of an input string is a palindrome. 

- Solution File Name: StringHasPalindromePermutation

**3\. Top Scores:** Write a function to efficiently sort numbers in an array, where each number is below a certain maximum.

- Solution File Name: SortScores

**4\. Total Sales From Sales Data:** Write a function that takes in a 2-dimensional array containing the product ID and sales quantity, and returns the total sales quantity for each product ID.

- Solution File Name: TotalSalesFromSalesData

----------------------------
### Greedy Algorithms
Solutions to greedy algorithm questions can be found in the package com.problems.interviewcake.code.greedy. Test cases can be found in the package com.problems.interviewcake.test.greedy. Test cases share the same name as the solution files, with Test added at the end. Greedy algorithm questions in my repo include:

**1\. Sell Stocks Once:** Write a function that determines the optimal buy and sell time for a given stock, given its prices yesterday.

- Solution File Name: SellStockOnce

**2\. Highest Product of 3 Integers:** Find the highest possible product that you can get by multiplying any 3 numbers in a given array.

- Solution File Name: HighestProduct3Ints

**3\. Product of All Other Numbers:** For each number in an array, find the product of all the other numbers.

- Solution File Name: ProductOfAllIntsExceptAtIndex

That's all for now. I plan to keep updating this page with new problems I solve, but we'll see how it goes.
